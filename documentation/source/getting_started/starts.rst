Fetal and Neonatal Imaging
==========================
Fetal and neonatal MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique used to study brain development, detect abnormalities, and assess structural and functional maturation in early life. Unlike ultrasound, MRI provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images with excellent soft tissue contrast, making it an essential tool for understanding early brain growth and pathology.
