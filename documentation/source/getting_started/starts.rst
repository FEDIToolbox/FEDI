Fetal and Neonatal MRI Overview
===================================

Fetal and Neonatal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are advanced diagnostic tools used to assess prenatal and early postnatal development, especially when ultrasound is inconclusive. MRI provides soft-tissue contrast and high-resolution 3D insights for precise evaluation of complex anatomy and pathology.

Key Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Fetal MRI**

* Performed typically after 18 weeks of gestation
* Offers superior visualization of the developing brain, lungs, and abdomen
* Essential for evaluating congenital anomalies and placental abnormalities

**Neonatal MRI**

* Performed shortly after birth, especially in critically ill newborns
* Crucial for identifying brain injuries such as Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
* Enables early assessment and monitoring of neurodevelopmental outcomes

Imaging Challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both modalities face specific processing challenges related to motion, physiology, and acquisition constraints:

**Fetal MRI:** Dominated by motion artifacts due to uncontrolled fetal movement, variable scanner positioning, and limited spatial resolution.

**Neonatal MRI:** Affected by patient motion, immature myelination leading to reduced tissue contrast, and increased vulnerability to physiological instability.
