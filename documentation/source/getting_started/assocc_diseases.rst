Fetal Brain Abnormalities: Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum (ACC)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Description:**
Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a congenital condition in which the corpus callosum, the structure that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, is partially or completely absent. It can be isolated or associated with other brain malformations or syndromes.

**Diagnosis with dMRI:**
Diffusion MRI (dMRI), especially Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), provides valuable information about white matter microstructure and can be used to visualize the absence or malformation of the corpus callosum in the fetus. The technique allows for the assessment of brain connectivity and fiber tract development, which is crucial in identifying ACC and related disorders.

**Clinical Utility:**
- Provides early diagnosis in utero.
- Assists in prognostic assessment and genetic counseling.
- Enables differentiation between isolated and syndromic ACC.
- Aids in planning perinatal management and postnatal care.
